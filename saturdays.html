    <h1>My Saturdays</h1> <!-- This is the title at the top of the page -->

    I would like to be part of a team that solves very hard technical problems. I'll grind every day because I simply like to learn things, it can be physics, ML, something from CS, music(guitar or piano), art, reading, whatever really. Nonetheless, also because...<br><br>

    Life in Peru is hard. No jobs for physicist or mathematicians. No interesting jobs even for very capable people but because of language barrier or legal things haven't migrated yet. No prestigious national labs. Extreme corruption in congress and goverment (specially in 2024, I don't want to think what is comming in 2025). No cool companies like Isomorphic Labs, Google, Nvidia, Meta, Deepmind, OpenAI, Anthropic, Jane Street, Medallion, Tesla, SpaceX, etc. just shit OOP(object oriented programming)/web developer 9-6 jobs. Everyday I wake up, go for breakfast, turn on the TV to see the news and there is never a single good new. Every day there is a new corruption case, embezzlement of funds, news of increasing cases of hitmens and murders. As if everyone here is a RL program and we were receiving a reward of -1 for the sole fact of existing. I love my country, but it is just sad to see how people in power is making every single effort to destroy it. I must escape... I must grind.
